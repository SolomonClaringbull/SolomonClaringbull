							<h3>Personal Information</h3>
							<p>Name: Solomon Claringbull</p>
							<p>Student Number: s3663489</p>
							<p>Email: solomonclaringbull3@gmail.com</p>
							<p>Background Information: I am an Australian from a 1st generation Australian family. I have graduated high school and received my HSC and ATAR, and I also received a Certificate III in Music Industry: Electronic Music Production in 2017 from SAE. I can only currently speak English. I am a huge fan of music; whether its listening to it, playing it (mainly guitar and piano) or making it via Ableton. I also love to play basketball and I try to practice as much as possible.</p>

							<h3>Interest In IT</h3>
							<p>Technology has always been an arm’s reach away from me since I was just a kid, from computers to TVs, I have always been using technology and have always been fascinated by the way it has improved our quality of life, through connecting everybody via social media or making technology like computers so advanced we can practically do anything. I always thought that IT was one, if not, the biggest up and coming industry, and with all the different avenues into a massive range careers it supplied, it seemed like the opportunities in a career of IT were endless, however, I was never interested in studying it myself until a conversation with my roommate about a Network Security subject he was doing in his university degree sparked my interest in possibly studying IT. Before this, I had never considered IT as an option of study, but after our conversation I decided to investigate Network Security and discovered that I was extremely interested in this field. </p>
						<p>This eventually resulted in me looking at different IT courses at different universities, and I finally came to a decision that RMIT was the university I wanted to study at. I found the variety and selection of subjects that were offered in the Bachelor’s Degree of Information Technology was exactly what I was interested in, and thought that if I ever was to go on to study a Master's Degree in an area of Network Security it provided a great pathway for this.</p>
							<p> Whilst studying my degree, I hope to learn about numerous areas of Information Technology, specifically Security and Programming. By the end of my degree, I aim to come out well versed in multiple computer languages, with an extremely broad understanding of the workings of the information technology industry. I expect to do some work integrated learning, such as an internship, and also partake in an overseas exchange, where I get to learn about another country’s approach to IT and how they teach it. This should provide me with the skills, knowledge and experience to succeed in the field of IT.</p>

							<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
							<p>Link to my ideal position:</p>
							<p>https://www.seek.com.au/job/38553328?searchrequesttoken=2546680a-b6c2-4391-b70b-0bf2482ba0ab&type=standard</p>
							<p>Photos of job description:</p>
							
							<div class="image"><img src="img1.jpg" width="766" height="468"><img src="img2.jpg" width="383" height="384"></div>
							
							<p>The position advertised is a Security Analyst, involving the protection of system networks and data, but with an innovative and creative approach. It would require me to work in a collaborative environment; such as a team. My team would be required to make vulnerability assessments and present solutions or issues to colleagues and business leaders in a way that other’s less knowledgeable in the area of security can understand. This role is appealing to me as it would be highly challenging, seeing as it requires me to constantly be ahead of the curb with my approach towards security. Working in a team environment is something I thoroughly enjoy, because the experience of striving towards a goal with other people is always rewarding, beneficial and exciting.</p>
					<p>This position requires me to have a degree related to Computer Science or another IT related degree. I also need a large understanding of networking, network security products and security technologies, along with being extremely proficient in TCP/IP networking. I need to have compliance with industry standards, brilliant communication skills and a general knowledge of Windows infrastructure.</p>
							<p>I feel that I already have great communication skills, and with time these should only get better as I am able to further develop them. I have been using computers since I was very young, so I assume that have a sufficient understanding of the Windows infrastructure and in about 3 years I will have finished my degree, therefore having a degree in an IT related field. However, this only satisfies 3 out the of the many requirements needed for this job.</p>
							<p>Currently, I do not have much experience in the IT industry, and I have no absolutely no experience in the area of security. Whilst I have an understanding of what security is, I am not very knowledgeable in this area yet and am hoping to gain more knowledge as I work through my degree. Throughout my degree I’m sure I will learn about networking, network security and security technologies, along with TCP and IP networking, but to have a broader understanding of these areas and to be proficient in them, I need to make a concerted effort to do outside research on these fields and make sure that when selecting majors, minors or electives for my degree, I aim to choose subjects related to these areas. By doing this, I will have accrued a range of security and network related courses on my academic transcript, helping my resume stand out of the crowd when applying for the position advertised or ones similar. The compliance with industry standards should come along with my understanding of security and network related areas, and I should obtain such compliance when doing any work experience in an IT related field. University is a perfect time to be social, with regular communication being a strong requirement in many of our classes as group work is involved. Continuous communication with my peers along with other students, as well as a concerted effort to push myself out of my comfort zone and attempt to meet and converse with people I would consider strangers should result in my communication skills significantly improving.  As I’m studying IT, my understanding of the Window’s infrastructure should only grow larger, even though I feel it is already sufficient. Through these actions I expect that by the end of my degree I should have close to, if not all the skills, qualifications and experience to obtain this position. </p>

					<p>(Test results for the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator)</p>
					<p>These results demonstrate to me that I am a creative minded person who excels in areas of creativity and social engagement, and that I heavily value creativity when it comes to working on a project and believe that communication is key when working in any environment. I feel that these traits are highly valuable in a group or workplace environment, as my social skills allow for me to engage well when working within a team and my creative flair helps to provide ideas that are outside of the box, helping my team approach projects in a more unique and innovative way. These results also show that I am someone who often makes decisions based on how they feel, rather than using logic, and whilst my intuitiveness helps me to make the correct decision, sometimes I can be blinded by feeling and often tend to act on this first, instead of stepping back and taking logic into account</p>
					<p>When working in a team, I feel that these results suggest that in a group, my role should be related to the creative side of a project. My love of socialising means that I am able to engage others in the group and help bring us together, strengthening our bond, allowing us to be more open with each other and discuss our ideas and opinions freely. In a group, I think that my creativity will allow for us to make innovative and creative projects, so that our work stands out in the crowd. </p>
					<p>Because I tend to listen to my feelings first, I need to make sure that I don’t lose sight of the logical side of Information Technology, as IT is often extremely logic based, and to always listen to my teammates and co-workers first and together work with them to make a decision that is logical, instead of pushing a decision that’s based purely on feeling. I need to take into account that whilst creativity is important, the functionality of an application, program or project is as important, and sometimes even more important, than how unique or special it can be, and to make sure that even though being social is important, achieving the group’s goal comes first. Although I need to be careful not to let my creativity and feelings run wild, I should remember that my creative ideas and ability to communicate are extremely valuable in a team environment and is always appreciated.</p>

							<h3>Project Ideas</h3>
							
								<p>Overview</p>
<p>
I have an idea to create an application that would enable up and coming musicians, managers or labels to easily get in contact with each other and share content such as videos, photos, mp3s etc via a messaging feature. This would help musicians find other musicians to collaborate with, or aid musicians in finding a manager/label or vice versa. The application’s intention is to be a social media for people in the music industry.
</p>
						
							<p>Motivation</p>
 <p>
As a musician, I have often found it hard to find other musicians that share the same vision or make the same music as me. Not only is it hard enough to find these kinds of people, but to find other musicians you often have to go out to music related events, such as gigs, festivals etc. This seems like a ridiculous and complicated way to find other musicians, as not only are these events not there for that purpose, but they also cost money, and even if you meet other musicians, there's a high chance they don't share the same ideas as you. I feel that there is a medium needed for other musicians to be able to contact each other so that they can easily start working on something together, as well as have the ability to get in contact with/find a manger or label to aid them in their career if their music begins to gain traction.
</p>
							<p>Description</p>

							<p>Features of this product:</p>
<p>
The user would have the ability to create a profile, from the choice of musician, manager or label. 

For a musician profile, the user would have to provide basic information to be shown on their profile such as; links to music previously made, general location, other forms of contact details (email, website, social media), a short description of music they make and some details about themselves (age, gender etc). There would be a verification process for a musician profile that would involve providing proof of music they have made (Soundcloud page, Spotify page etc) so that it filters out fake profiles, allowing only musicians who already have a musical catalogue to have a profile on the app.

For a manage profile, the user would have to provide basic information to be shown on their profile such as; links to artists they manage/have managed, general location, other forms of contact details (website, social media) and a short description of who they are and their approach towards management. There would be a verification process for a manager profile, such as providing proof of the artists/musicians they have managed (such as a management contract) so that it filters out fake profiles and mangers who would otherwise be deemed untrustworthy.

For a label profile, the user would have to provide basic information to be shown on their profile such as; links to/examples of artists and managers on their label, a website, the label’s social media, their general location and a short description of their label and their approach towards the music industry. There would be a verification process for a label profile, such as providing proof of the artists/musicians/mangers on their label (such as contracts) so that it filters out fake profiles and untrustworthy labels.

There would be a hierarchy. This hierarchy would work as such:
-	Musicians can contact other musicians with no constraints and are able to send as many messages as they want.
-	Musicians can only contact managers/label with a limit of 2 total messages and cannot send anymore until the manager/label responds to these messages. This prevents a flood of messages from musicians trying to get a manager/label. Once the manager or label has responded to a musician’s message, both parties will have the ability to communicate freely.
-	Managers can freely contact any musicians they wish
-	Managers can contact labels but only with a limit of 2 messages and cannot send anymore until the label responds, preventing a flood of messages from managers trying to get in contact with a label. Once the label has responded to their message, both parties will have the ability to communicate freely.
   
When a user sends a message to another user, it will automatically send a request to add the other user to their contacts. Users can also add another user without sending a message first, through the feature of an add button. When sending messages, users would have the ability to send them in the form of text, images, files, voice recordings or videos. When a user accepts messages from another user, both users will have the ability to either video call or voice call each other. All users will have to ability to block another user if they don’t wish for the user to contact them or see their profile.

To search for another user, there would be a search engine where you can input names of other users or use the search engine’s selection criteria where you can select to search by musician, manager, or label.  When searching using a name, the search results will display the profile/s with name. If there are no results for the inputted name, the search results will display ‘No Results’. When searching via the musician criteria, a user will have the option to refine the search with different criteria, these criteria being; genre (hip-hop, electronic etc.) and location. If these options are selected, the search results will only display musicians that relate to the selected criteria, eg. User selects to search for musician and refines the search to musicians that make hip-hop and are located around Melbourne. The search results will only display musicians that create hip-hop and are located around Melbourne. When a user chooses to search for a manager or label, they will have the option to refine their search with the criteria of location. If the user inputs location, then the search results will only display managers or labels that are related to entered criteria, eg. User selects to search for managers and refines the search to managers that are located around Melbourne. The search results will only display managers located around Melbourne. When search results have been displayed, users will also have the option to sort these results via a button that sorts the results by either relevancy to entered criteria, newest users, or oldest users, depending on how the user wishes to sort the results. 
							</p>
							<p>Tools and Technologies</p>
<p>To create my application, I can either build it from scratch using a programming language (such as Java), or I could use an application builder and hosting service for iOS and Android. Coding an application from scratch takes time, and you need to be skilled in a programming language, so currently this option is not feasible. I can create my application via a web-based builder and hosting service called AppGyver Composer 2. This service would provide me with the ability to create an application that has UI elements like navigation bars, page transitions, modals, tab bars etc without needing to code. It also provides a feature where you can implement custom modules, which I can take advantage of once I get more skilled in code. 
							</p>
							<p>Skills Required</p>
<p>The skills required would be an extensive knowledge in programming, so that I would have the ability to create the app, along with excellent communication skills so I am able to pitch my project idea to investors, companies or other programmers when trying to recruit them to help with creating the application. I must have a broad understanding in UX design (User experience design), to make sure that users can easily use and navigate the application and I need to be able to build a DBMS (Database Management System). Acquiring all these skills is possible, but it will not be easy, and it would take time, but whilst studying my degree I should obtain at least a few of these skills.
							</p>
							<p>Outcome</p>
<p>If the application becomes successful and widely used, the outcome of this project would result in a more tightknit music community, with musicians having the ability to contact each other, broadening the opportunities for collaboration with other musicians, therefore providing many prospects for musicians to progress in their craft and career. With the ability to contact each other easily, musicians, managers and labels would be able to create important connections and relationships that could assist them in progressing and creating a career within the music industry, something that they may have struggled with prior to the application’s development.

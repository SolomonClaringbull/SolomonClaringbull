							<h3>Personal Information</h3>
							<p>Name: Solomon Claringbull</p>
							<p>Student Number: s3663489</p>
							<p>Email: solomonclaringbull3@gmail.com</p>
							<p>Background Information: I am an Australian from a 1st generation Australian family. I have graduated high school and received my HSC and ATAR, and I also received a Certificate III in Music Industry: Electronic Music Production in 2017 from SAE. I can only currently speak English. I am a huge fan of music; whether its listening to it, playing it (mainly guitar and piano) or making it via Ableton. I also love to play basketball and I try to practice as much as possible.</p>

							<h3>Interest In IT</h3>
							<p>Technology has always been an arm’s reach away from me since I was just a kid, from computers to TVs, I have always been using technology and have always been fascinated by the way it has improved our quality of life, through connecting everybody via social media or making technology like computers so advanced we can practically do anything. I always thought that IT was one, if not, the biggest up and coming industry, and with all the different avenues into a massive range careers it supplied, it seemed like the opportunities in a career of IT were endless, however, I was never interested in studying it myself until a conversation with my roommate about a Network Security subject he was doing in his university degree sparked my interest in possibly studying IT. Before this, I had never considered IT as an option of study, but after our conversation I decided to investigate Network Security and discovered that I was extremely interested in this field. </p>
						<p>This eventually resulted in me looking at different IT courses at different universities, and I finally came to a decision that RMIT was the university I wanted to study at. I found the variety and selection of subjects that were offered in the Bachelor’s Degree of Information Technology was exactly what I was interested in, and thought that if I ever was to go on to study a Master's Degree in an area of Network Security it provided a great pathway for this.</p>
							<p> Whilst studying my degree, I hope to learn about numerous areas of Information Technology, specifically Security and Programming. By the end of my degree, I aim to come out well versed in multiple computer languages, with an extremely broad understanding of the workings of the information technology industry. I expect to do some work integrated learning, such as an internship, and also partake in an overseas exchange, where I get to learn about another country’s approach to IT and how they teach it. This should provide me with the skills, knowledge and experience to succeed in the field of IT.</p>

							<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
							<p>Link to my ideal position:</p>
							<p>https://www.seek.com.au/job/38553328?searchrequesttoken=2546680a-b6c2-4391-b70b-0bf2482ba0ab&type=standard</p>

							<div class="image"><img src="img2.jpg" width="766" height="468"></div>
							<p>The position advertised is a Security Analyst, involving the protection of system networks and data, but with an innovative and creative approach. It would require me to work in a collaborative environment; such as a team. My team would be required to make vulnerability assessments and present solutions or issues to colleagues and business leaders in a way that other’s less knowledgeable in the area of security can understand. This role is appealing to me as it would be highly challenging, seeing as it requires me to constantly be ahead of the curb with my approach towards security. Working in a team environment is something I thoroughly enjoy, because the experience of striving towards a goal with other people is always rewarding, beneficial and exciting.</p>
					<p>This position requires me to have a degree related to Computer Science or another IT related degree. I also need a large understanding of networking, network security products and security technologies, along with being extremely proficient in TCP/IP networking. I need to have compliance with industry standards, brilliant communication skills and a general knowledge of Windows infrastructure.</p>
							<p>I feel that I already have great communication skills, and with time these should only get better as I am able to further develop them. I have been using computers since I was very young, so I assume that have a sufficient understanding of the Windows infrastructure and in about 3 years I will have finished my degree, therefore having a degree in an IT related field. However, this only satisfies 3 out the of the many requirements needed for this job.</p>
							<p>Currently, I do not have much experience in the IT industry, and I have no absolutely no experience in the area of security. Whilst I have an understanding of what security is, I am not very knowledgeable in this area yet and am hoping to gain more knowledge as I work through my degree. Throughout my degree I’m sure I will learn about networking, network security and security technologies, along with TCP and IP networking, but to have a broader understanding of these areas and to be proficient in them, I need to make a concerted effort to do outside research on these fields and make sure that when selecting majors, minors or electives for my degree, I aim to choose subjects related to these areas. By doing this, I will have accrued a range of security and network related courses on my academic transcript, helping my resume stand out of the crowd when applying for the position advertised or ones similar. The compliance with industry standards should come along with my understanding of security and network related areas, and I should obtain such compliance when doing any work experience in an IT related field. University is a perfect time to be social, with regular communication being a strong requirement in many of our classes as group work is involved. Continuous communication with my peers along with other students, as well as a concerted effort to push myself out of my comfort zone and attempt to meet and converse with people I would consider strangers should result in my communication skills significantly improving.  As I’m studying IT, my understanding of the Window’s infrastructure should only grow larger, even though I feel it is already sufficient. Through these actions I expect that by the end of my degree I should have close to, if not all the skills, qualifications and experience to obtain this position. </p>
